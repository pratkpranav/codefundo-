After interacting with a lot of foreigners inside my campus IITD I got to know about the problems they face during their trip through India is the demand of high fare by the local taxi drivers, auto-rickshaws even ola and uber people also. I met this problem myself when I came out of my hometime to Delhi for the first time. After a lot of mind scrapping,I come to a solution of creating an app which shows the usual fare between any two-place throughout our country especially near the places of tourist attractions which will be a great help for them as well as for us also.
